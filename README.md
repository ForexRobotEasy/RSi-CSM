## Code Explanation

The code is written in MQL5 and consists of several functions that handle different aspects of the expert advisor.

### Initialization (OnInit)

In the `OnInit` function, the trade parameters are set up using the `CTrade` class. The expert magic number and name are assigned to identify the trades made by this expert advisor. The `CIndicators` class is used to add the RSI and MACD indicators for market analysis.

### Market Analysis and Trading (OnTick)

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the market. It retrieves the current values of the RSI and MACD indicators using the `CIndicators` class. Based on the market analysis, if the RSI is above 70 and the MACD line is above the signal line, a buy trade is opened using the `CTrade` class. If the RSI is below 30 and the MACD line is below the signal line, a sell trade is opened.

### Trade Event Handling (OnTrade)

The `OnTrade` function is called when a trade event occurs. In this code, it checks if there are open trades using the `IsTradeOpen` method of the `CTrade` class. If there are open trades, it checks if the profit has reached 100 pips. If so, it closes all open trades using the `CloseAll` method.

### Deinitialization (OnDeinit)

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the expert advisor is being deinitialized. It is responsible for cleaning up and closing any open trades using the `CloseAll` method of the `CTrade` class.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may need further customization and error handling to suit specific trading strategies and requirements.
